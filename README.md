8/17/11 - Bubble Sort v1.0

This is a Ruby implementation of a ["Bubble Sort"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort). I wanted to work on my Ruby chops and dive into algorithms and noticed a dearth of well-documented Ruby examples, so I made one myself. Hopefully this will be helpful to someone finding themselves in a similar situation.
