Bubble Sort v1.1 Notes
======================
8/19/11   

Added the ability to stop once the array is sorted, rather than stepping through every set of elements all the time. Cleaned it up with methods and a Class. Commented the line to see each iteration printed out.


Mike's Ruby Bubble Sort v1.0
============================
8/17/11   

This is a Ruby implementation of a ["Bubble Sort"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort). I wanted to work on my Ruby chops and dive into algorithms and noticed a dearth of well-documented Ruby examples, so I made one myself. Hopefully this will be helpful to someone finding themselves in a similar situation.

Wikipedia: ["Bubble Sort"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)   
[Sorting Algorithms Site](http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/bubble-sort)(with hot animated sorting action)
    
Cheers!
