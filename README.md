Sorting With Ruby
============================  
Welcome! As a budding Rubyist, I wanted to work on my Ruby chops and dive into algorithms. I noticed a dearth of well-documented Ruby examples, so I made some myself. Hopefully this will be helpful to someone looking to get started in sorting algorithms and/or Ruby. I am aware there is a `sort` method, but like most things I wanted to pick it apart and see how it worked. I'd love feedback on some more clever ways to do these.

Algorithms to Include:
----------------------
1.  Bubble Sort
2.  Selection Sort
3.  *Insertion Sort (coming soon)*
4.  *Quick Sort (coming soon)*


Selection Sort
--------------
>"A selection sort finds the minimum value, swaps it with the value in the first position, and repeats these steps for the remainder of the list."

Bubble Sort
-----------

Ruby implementation of the infamously inefficient ["Bubble Sort"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)     

[Sorting Algorithms - Bubble Sort](http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/bubble-sort) (*now with hot animated sorting action*)

*   Added the ability to stop once the array is sorted, rather than stepping through every set of elements all the time. Cleaned it up with methods and a Class. Commented the line to see each iteration printed out.
